Parkinson’s Disease Classification from Speech Data using multiple 
Machine Learning approaches

# Abstract
In this project, multiple modern machine learning and pattern 
recognition methods have been used in order to classify or predict the 
risk of Parkinson’s disease based on speech signal data. The methods 
discussed in this project consist of a number of classification methods 
(i.e. Naïve Bayes, K-NN, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks), as well 
as some “Ensemble” learning techniques where we attempt to improve the 
accuracy by combining several models. The performance of the methods has 
been assessed with a reliable dataset from UCI repository. An ensemble 
method outperformed other individual models including more complex ones 
like neural networks.
